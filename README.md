# piano-tools

## Depends

- Bravura font need to be installed on the sytem for note rendering
- RtMidi for supporting MIDI devices
- Qt5 for user interface

For Arch you can use the following AUR packages:

- otf-bravura https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/otf-bravura
- rtmidi      https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rtmidi
